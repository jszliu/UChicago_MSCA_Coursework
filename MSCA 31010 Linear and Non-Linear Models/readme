ðŸ“˜ MSCA31010 - Linear & Non-Linear Models (Winter 2022)
This repository contains my coursework for MSCA31010, covering various modeling and machine learning techniques applied to real-world datasets. Below is a summary of each assignment:

ðŸ“‚ Assignment 1 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis & Logistic Regression
File: MSCA31010_Assignment 1(1).ipynb

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a binary classification dataset.

Performed feature engineering and preprocessing.

Built a logistic regression model and evaluated it using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Introduced basic model interpretation techniques.

ðŸ“‚ Assignment 2 â€“ Penalized Logistic Regression
File: MSCA31010_HW2_Zihao_Liu.ipynb

Applied Ridge and Lasso penalized logistic regression using cross-validation.

Compared model performance and feature selection behavior under both penalties.

Interpreted coefficient shrinkage and model sparsity.

Visualized regularization paths.

ðŸ“‚ Assignment 3 â€“ Categorical Predictors & Forward Selection
File: MSCA31010_Assignment_3_Zihao_Liu.pdf

Visualized categorical and continuous predictors in relation to customer churn.

Used Forward Selection to build a logistic model with statistical reporting (Deviance Chi-square, LL, etc.).

Evaluated model using multiple R-squared metrics, AUC, and error metrics.

Chose optimal threshold based on F1 Score to minimize misclassification.

ðŸ“‚ Assignment 4 â€“ Tree-based Models
File: MSCA31010_Assignment4_Code.py

Implemented and tuned Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.

Compared model performance with logistic regression baseline.

Included code for plotting feature importance and model diagnostics.
